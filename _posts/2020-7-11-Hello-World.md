As Sebastian Ruder suggested in his ["10 Tips for Research and a PhD"](https://ruder.io/10-tips-for-research-and-a-phd/), I wanna start my blogging here to share my experience in Ph.D studies and document interesting NLP knowledge. Appreciate all the constructive feedback, and hope everyone can learn and grow here.
