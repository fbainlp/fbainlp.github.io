title: QA models on IE Tasks
---

As a NLP practitioner, whose research filed is Information Extraction (IE), I recently 
found that more and more IE tasks have been SOTAed by Question Answering (QA) models, 
which raises questions: why do QA models work so well? Do QA model architectures 
inherently approach IE tasks better than those traditional architectures? To answer 
these questions, in this blog, I survey four papers, which covers three IE tasks 
Name Entity Extraction (NER), Relation Extraction (RE) and Event Extraction 
(EE). I compare those proposed models with other competitive non-QA models and reveal 
whether QA models are as magical as they have been advertised.

## Relation Classification as Two-way Span-Prediction


## Event Extraction by Answering (Almost) Natural Questions


## Event Extraction as Machine Reading Comprehension
